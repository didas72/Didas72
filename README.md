### Hello! I'm Diogo Cruz Diniz, or Didas72, even simply Didas, depending on where you know me from.

- I'm a Computer Science student at Instituto Superior Tecnico - Taguspark.
- I have been interested in programming since I was 11, when I started learning how to use scratch. Since then I have explored 3D modelling with Blender, game dev with Unity, had a wide variety of projects written in C# and recently have been programming mostly in C/C++.  
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Rust in my free time.
