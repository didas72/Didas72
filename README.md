### Hello! I'm Diogo Cruz Diniz, or Didas72, even simply Didas, depending on where you know me from.

- I'm a Computer Science and Software Engineering student at Instituto Superior Tecnico - Taguspark.
- I have been interested in programming since I was 11, when I started learning how to use Scratch. Since then, I have explored 3D modeling with Blender, game-dev with Unity, had a wide variety of projects written in C# and recently have been programming mostly in C.  
- Currently working on a file system, written in C, and a RISC-V assembly preprocessor, written in C#.
